<h2>Coldplay Fun Page</h2>

   The project was created to show a wider audience the work of Coldplay band. The created website should present how diverse and colorful is the music composed by the group and how enthusiastic are their members. We can find the "Music" section where the whole discography of the band is and listen to all their songs. In the "Video" section we can enjoy many music videos. Visiting the "Pictures" we can have occasion to see photos from one of the live performances. In the "Concerts" section we can check where the band is going to perform later this year. 
   All visual presentation is simple and clean to focus the attention of visitors on the work of the band. The group members, especially the leader are the main interested of the funs, therefore the website provides a wide range of information about them, encourage visitors to spend more time browsing through the content.
